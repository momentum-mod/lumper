> *Momentum Mod is a standalone game built on the Source Engine, aiming to centralize movement gametypes found in CS:S, CS:GO, and TF2.*

Lumper is a .NET based tool developed by the Momentum Mod Team for manipulating BSP files, the Source engine's compiled map format.
It is aimed at map reviewers and porters, giving them the ability to analyse and tweak BSP files without having to decompile then recompile.
